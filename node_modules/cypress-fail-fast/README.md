# Cypress Fail Fast

Enables fail fast in Cypress, skipping the rest of tests on first failure.

## Installation

Add the plugin to `devDependencies`

```bash
npm i --save-dev cypress-fail-fast
```

Inside `cypress/plugins/index.js`:

```javascript
module.exports = (on, config) => {
  require("cypress-fail-fast/plugin")(on, config);
  return config;
};
```

At the top of `cypress/support/index.js`:

```javascript
import "cypress-fail-fast";
```

## Usage

Use the environment variable CYPRESS_FAIL_FAST to enable fail fast:

```bash
CYPRESS_FAIL_FAST=true npm run cypress
```

or Set the "env" key in your cypress.json configuration file:

```json
{
  "env":
  {
    "FAIL_FAST": true
  }
}
```

## Caveats

The plugin uses tests' internal properties such as the `state`, `currentRetrys`, etc, so it may stop working on each new Cypress release. To avoid this it has been tested with Cypress versions from 5.0.0, and new releases will be published for each new Cypress minor or major releases, updating the Cypress version used in the package E2E tests.

If you find some issue please check the latest tested version in the `devDependencies` of the `package.json` files of the E2E tests at https://github.com/javierbrea/cypress-fail-fast/blob/main/test-e2e/cypress-5/package.json and https://github.com/javierbrea/cypress-fail-fast/blob/main/test-e2e/cypress-6/package.json.

## Acknowledgements

This plugin has been developed based on the solutions proposed by the community on this [Cypress issue](https://github.com/cypress-io/cypress/issues/518), so thanks to all! I hope this plugin can be deprecated soon, as soon as the Cypress team adds native support for this feature. ðŸ˜ƒ
